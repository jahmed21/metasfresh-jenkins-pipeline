 * @param buildId is used as value for the {@code MF_UPSTREAM_BUILDNO} job parameter
 * @param upstreamBranch the preferred branch. If there is a jenkins job for that branch, it will be invoked. Otherwise the {@code master} branch's job will be invoked.
 * @param parentPomVersion is used as value for the {@code MF_PARENT_VERSION} job parameter
 * @param skipToDist is used as value for the {@code MF_SKIP_TO_DIST} job parameter (only evalated by the metasfresh jobs!)

 * @param wait if {@code true}, then this invokcation will wait for the invkoked job to finish and will fail if the invoked job fails.
 * @param jobFolderName the jenkins job folder name which also happens to be the github repository name of the project that we want to invoke here. Is used as prefix for the name of the job to be called.
